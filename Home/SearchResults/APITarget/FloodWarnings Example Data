            "message": "Groundwater levels at our Longacre borehole in the Lambourn area have recently started to decline slowly due to the limited rainfall over the last week. Groundwater levels are still above normal for this time of year and are still high and close to a level where communities may be affected by flooding from groundwater if we receive heavy rainfall. \nWe expect groundwater levels to remain high over the next week but they are continuing to fall slowly.  The groundwater levels remain sensitive to further rainfall and could start to rise again in response to further rainfall.   Low-lying land and roads will therefore continue to be at risk of flooding. Due to the nature of groundwater behaviour, this situation could continue for several weeks or longer.\nWe are continuing to monitor groundwater levels and will update this message Tuesday 09/03/2021, or as the situation changes.
